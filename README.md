## Story

Children are the future! But they are also very clumsyâ€¦ When kids play it is inevitable that there is some distress among them. They drop their food, lose their toys or hurt themselves.

You are a supervisor of a school playground on which children are having fun. Due to the inevitable budget cuts of the government you will need to supervise more and more children. You need to be fast and help the children when they are in distress. By doing this you delay the moment of complete chaos on the playground!

## Gameplay
- You can move by using the WASD keys
- You need to take care of the children during recess, when children have distress they will start crying. You can complete a level by solving all distress during the set amount of time, their break.
  - The child in distress shows tears (:sweat_drops:) and an exclamation mark (:exclamation:) so you know where to go.
  - When you move close enough to a child in distress it will resolve their distress
- The panic-o-meter will increase by one when a child goes into a panic, when you have more than 5 children in panic-mode you will loose
- Difficulty will increase by having less time in between the children that need attention / more children on the playground.
You cannot walk through the playground equipment.
